# graphql-api

Pet graphql api for all juns)

1. So, the first you need to install lts version of Node.js (16.17.1 is lts for 03.10.2022)
2. After that, let me intoduce you to pnpm, fastest and modern package manager, https://pnpm.io/installation
   It's coming with Node engine, like npm, but in corepack experimental features, so for install pnpm, just simply run:

- corepack enable
- corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

3. For this moment just dev script is working, so run pnpm dev to run server locally at localhost:4000/graphql
